Talking about your family:
    My parents got married 25 years ago.
    I've got two brothers and sister.
    So there are six of us in my family.
    My brothers are twins and they are three years younger than me.
    I'm the oldest and I take after my father.
    My sister takes after my father in some ways, but she look like my mother.
    We're a close family.
    My best friend Pete is an only child; he spends a lot of time with us and he's almost one of the family.

twins = two children born to one mother at the same time
take after sb = to be similar to in appearance and/or character
look like sb = when sb's appearance is similar to sb else
close family = we have a good relationship/see each other a lot
